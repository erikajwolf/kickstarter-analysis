# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## In this project, we'll see the similarities and differences between different categories of kickstarter's, their countries, and their rate of success or failure
To start Louise off with the most success, she may want to consider launching her theater campaign in May or June, as our data supports the highest number of successful campaigns launched in these months. Additionally, we have findings to support that the vast majority (75%) of GB campaigns for plays finish successfully. 
However, Louise should be cautious with her estimated budget. She is currently seeking $12k for 'Fever', but the average successful theater campaign total approximately $5000. 

Overall, Louise should be optimistic for her campaign, and the category of campaigns with the highest success rate is Theater!
